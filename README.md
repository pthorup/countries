## Country App

This app is made as my solution to an assignment on Next.js. It is a simple app that displays a list of countries grouped by continents. It also has a country-guessing game.

## Tech Used

-  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
-  [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
-  CSS modules
-  couple of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) snapshot tests
